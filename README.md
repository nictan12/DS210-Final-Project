This project aims to map out a graph of Bitcoin (BTC) Alpha trust networks between users (vertices) based on past interactions and transactions. The weighted edges represent trust scores between 0 and 1, with 0 being complete distrust while 1 is full trust. This code first computes the average trust rating of each user, before looking at the likelihood that users separated by at least one mutual trust each other as well. The graph is represented in a [adjacency list, list of edges, adjacency matrix], utilises the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) dataset with 3,783 nodes and 24,186 edges.
